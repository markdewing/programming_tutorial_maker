% Development of a mini C++ MPI3 wrapper
% Name: Broadcast array

The next improvement is to broadcast an array type with a start iterator and a length.
And make it work with a variety of array types (raw C++ arrays, STL containers)

Here the issue is obtaining the address corresponding to the start iterator.
We are assuming the container storage is contiguous.

One solution is to declare a templated `get_pointer` function
that is overloaded on different types - C++ pointer, STL iterator, etc.
