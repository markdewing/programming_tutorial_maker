% Development of a mini C++ MPI3 wrapper
% Name: Communicator

Add a communicator class.  For now it contains a rank function to get the MPI rank.
Eventually it will contain most of the communication functions.

The raw `MPI_Comm` value is stored internally to the class.

Add a method to the environment to get a world communicator object.
(Todo: explain the use of static get_world_instance.)
